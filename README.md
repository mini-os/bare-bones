# Bare Bones
This repo contains the `Bare Bones` OSDev tutorial, 
but also comes with support for building a local cross-compiler.

## Building the Cross-Compiler
Save yourself some time and just run `make third_party`.
It will take a while, but it builds to `third_party/cross`.
This installation is local to this project

## Running
`make run`

## Building an ISO
`make iso`
